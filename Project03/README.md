# Project03 - Blog site

## Has two major app - Blog & Searches

## Blog App
The application works by having the user make blog posts.

## Admin User
Can create an super user to be able to easily edit information on site/project. Can create super user using `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` and then going on admin page from navbar to login.

## Open/Run application
Can run/open website by going on virtual environment and running `python3 manage.py runserver localhost:10010`

## Navbar
There is a navbar at the top of all pages so users can always access it at all times. 

### Blogs Navbar
The Blogs Navbar will show a list of all the blogs that are saved on the database. The content of each blog may be compressed to a short amount, so user's can click on view on a specific blog post to see the entire blog post. 

### About Navbar
Just a basic filler text describing what the purpose of said blog site is. 

### Search
Can search blog posts by title names

### Login Issues: 
Encountered issues with login with no reverse match which I was unable to fix
